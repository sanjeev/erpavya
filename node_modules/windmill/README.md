windmill
========

simple file-based blog engine

**in development**, feel free to contribute but use at your own risk.

# setup

- open a console
- create a directory for your blog
- `cd` inside that directory and type `npm install windmill`
- paste this: `echo "require('windmill')" >> index.js`
- now running `node index.js` will start your blog on default port (3000)
- finally, replicate this file structure:

```
public/
        css/
        js/
        img/
posts/
```

# writing your first post

post's filename are pretty simple: `YEARMONTHDAY_title.post`, so for `May 15th 2012` it would be `20130514`.

every post has a header which contain the post info, it's a JSON header like this:
```javascript
{
    "title" : "Example Post",
    "published" : "Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00",
    "author" : "Tommy Bergeron <tomshreds@me.com>"
}
```

the header must be **first 5 lines of every post**.

the rest of the file is dedicated to your post's **markdown** formatted content.

# config

you can create a `config.json` that looks like this:

```javascript
{
    "title" : "Example Blog"
    "port" : 3000
}
```


# themes

the default theme is not modifiable yet since this package is in very early development.
